$ git commit --amend

This command is used to amend the last commit in the current branch. The --amend option is specific to the git commit subcommand. When you use git commit --amend, Git combines your staged changes with the previous commit instead of creating a new commit. This is useful for making small changes to the most recent commit or adding files you forgot to include.
